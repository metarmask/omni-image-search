Simplest way to Google image.

Since images.google.com is not in the Chrome search engine list by default, I decided to write this tiny utility to help people Google images easier and faster.


How to use
----

1. Type "img" and a space into the omnibox (address bar)
2. Enter a search query
3. Hit enter

Tip: use Ctrl + L, âŒ˜ + L or Alt+D to quickly give the omnibox focus.
