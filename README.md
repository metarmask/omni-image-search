Simplest way to Google image.

Since images.google.com is not in the Chrome search engine list by default, I decided to write this tiny utility to help people Google images easier and faster.


How to use
----

1. Type "img" into your omnibox (address bar).
2. Hit \<tab\>.
3. Type your keywords and hit enter.

Tip: use Ctrl + L / Command + L to quickly give omnibox focus.
